# University of Utah NeuroRobotics Lab

*Our research seeks to assist and rehabilitate individuals with life-altering neuromuscular impairments (e.g., stroke, spinal cord injury, limb loss). Our research links rehabilitation robotics and sensorimotor neural engineering through biologically-inspired artificial intelligence. We leverage wearable and implantable brain-machine interfaces to restore and/or enhance human function.*
